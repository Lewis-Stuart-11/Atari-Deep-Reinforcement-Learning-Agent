How to run:
	1) Install the following required modules:
		- PyTorch
		- Torchvis
		- Numpy
		- Gym
		- Atari_py
		- Pandas
		- Matplotlib
		- Openpyxl
		- Xlsxwriter
	2) To create a diagram of the neural network, GraphVis executables must be installed and set as an OS environment variable path.
	   If this is not desirable, set the variable 'show_neural_network' to False
	3) Currently atari_py has an error where the file 'ale.py' is not included in the module package, this can be solved by downloading the module
	   from the atari_py github page, rather than downloading through PIP
	4) Now that everything is installed, the program can be executed by running main.py. The game to run can be changed by setting the variable 
	   'default_atari_game' to one of the avaliable atari games (each game must have an 'optimal_game_parameter' namedtuple assigned to it)
	5) A series of parameters for the different games have been set in the 'optimal_game_parameters' file, these can be edited and run
